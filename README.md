flightDeck

Despite the name, more of a general purpose 'office chair' with accessories for intensive 'desk work' and VR. Assumes a fairly typical 'driver's seat' power chair.

Goal is that no muscles other than those used for the controls are under significant tension. Recent Secret Lab Evo chairs have been sufficient to achieve this, albeit in a limited range of desk heights, etc, as an example.

# Usage


# Distribution

Consider providing end-users an entire copy of this repository with all submodules, in addition to PDF documents. Physical USB flash devices may be suitable for the repository, printed hardcopy may be suitable for the PDF documents.


# Design

WARNING: Units are mixed. Some sketches and other dimensions use inches, some use metric. This is due to the combination of commodity lumber de-facto standards with designs for metric components.


Chair is illustrated only roughly. Seat length includes leg extension fully extended.

Bolt hole positions for chair and such are NOT modeled in CAD. Only important landmarks are modeled.


# Redistribution and Preservation

Entire 'recursive' clones of this repository with all submodules may be appropriate for redistribution and preservation.


# Safety

DANGER: Powered chairs have moving machinery and other components designed for automotive use. Pinch points or other hazards may be present.


# FutureWork



# Findings

Vertical width of 38 inch was well chosen and should remain as is.


Foot rest should be much closer and could be much longer.

Wheels were not as useful as hoped, due to the center of gravity being far from the wheels, more so than expected, so tilting is not easy.

Stability is very robust - panel-ChairFloor could be shorter.


Sidestick position should not be positioned forward, but instead as far back as possible, for compatibility with a desk. Being able to slide the seat back to the controls, or forward to reach a desk, is a convenient and effective feature. There is no obvious disadvantage in practice to this compatibility feature.

Sidestick position is surprisingly quite tight tolerance.


Tilt useful for chair is about half - a 3/4inch rise at the front of the chair instead of 1 1/2 inch.

Sidestick useful tilt is significantly less. Sidestick also should NOT be raised above the seat height chosen for the controlsDeck panels. Unexpectedly, such rise is not needed, and also unexpectedly, nor does such rise fit well with the organic motion of the chair lift function.


Long screws are necessary for timber-controlsDeck.


VR headset stowage and such can and should easily be added as a few 2x4 timbers.



Entering and exiting the seat is apparently best done by climbing out. Though not as much a nuisance as this may seem, a handrail would be useful.




# Reference


# Directory Specification

Consider keeping a copy of this specification alongside relevant projects for reference.

Please regard as a loose specification intended to offer unallocated regions for expansion and subordinate to any improvements that may be found in actual implementations.


Projects which may be assembled into larger projects, if sufficiently well-developed, should include their own appropriate directories, rather than referencing files shared within larger projects. That is to say, a sort of 'static linking' approach is strongly recommended.



Numbered directories with '[z]-' in their prefix and a '/' may substitute the '/' for either a '-' or separate directories.

Numbered directories of top-directories may be placed alongside top-directories if desired. Numbering scheme is intended to minimize conflicts.

Templates should populate only the most usual directories. Not all directories need be populated for a project.
